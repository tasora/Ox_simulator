This directory contains textures, fonts, objects that 
will be used by your project.

Hint: if you build the executable, say, in D:/test/bin/release/,  
this directory should be copied in D:/test/bin/data/ because the
template demo access the directories in ../data/.
This copy can be automated by the CHRONOENGINE_COPY_PROJECT_DATA_DIR
macro in CMakeList.txt.
